        title: 'My First Time as an Escort: A Confessional',
        excerpt: 'A raw and honest account of my first night working as an escort in Nairobi...',
        content: `
    I was only 22 when I took the plunge into this world, fresh out of university with dreams bigger than my empty bank account could handle. Life in Nairobi wasn't cheap—rent, family expectations, that nagging itch for independence. I'd been scraping by with odd jobs, but one evening over drinks with my best friend, she mentioned something. 'Hii Nairobi ni mimi tu na Alchemyst ndio nitoboe' she said, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She'd been working as an escort for a few months, raking in cash that let her afford those designer bags I could only window-shop. Upon inquiry, she told me it was some website you could list as an Escort and get clients. "You should try it!", she added jokingly.

I laughed it off at first, but the next day, curiosity won. I pulled up the site on my phone, heart racing as I created my profile. Uploading photos—me in a slinky red dress that hugged my curves, smiling coyly—felt exposing, vulnerable. I listed my services: companionship, massages with a happy ending, full girlfriend experience. Added details about my age, my love for deep conversations over wine. Hit publish, and just like that, I was out there, waiting for the world to notice. 

The wait was torture. A day turned into two, and I checked my inbox obsessively, nerves twisting in my stomach. What if no one messaged? What if they did, and I froze? I imagined every worst-case scenario: a creepy guy, awkward silences, or worse, not being good enough. But my friend kept texting encouragement: 'Trust me, your first one changes everything.' Then, on a chilly Tuesday evening in Westlands, my phone buzzed. A booking request. My hands shook as I read it—a businessman in his late 30s, staying at the Sarova Panafric, one of those upscale hotels with marble lobbies and city views. He wanted two hours, GFE, nothing too wild. Polite message, even included a photo of himself: tall, salt-and-pepper hair, kind eyes. I accepted, my pulse thundering like a drum.

Getting ready was a ritual of self-doubt and hype. I showered, shaved every inch—legs, pussy, underarms—until my skin tingled. Slipped into black lace lingerie that made my C-cup breasts look perky and inviting, topped with a simple black dress that skimmed my thighs. Spritzed perfume on my wrists and neck, the scent of jasmine calming my jitters. As I did my makeup—smoky eyes, red lips—I stared at my reflection. 'You got this,' I whispered. But inside, I was a mess: excited for the cash (he was offering 15,000 KSh, more than a month's rent), terrified of the unknown. Why was I doing this? Financial freedom, sure—to send money home to my mom, buy that laptop for my side hustle in graphic design. And yeah, a thrill of adventure, the forbidden rush of turning my body into power.

The taxi ride to Westlands felt eternal, city lights blurring past as Nairobi's evening hum filled the air. matatus honking, street vendors calling out. I clutched my purse, rehearsing my intro: 'Hi, I'm Patricia, so glad to meet you.' The hotel loomed elegant and intimidating. The concierge—a sharp-dressed woman with a subtle nod—gave me that knowing smile, like she'd seen a hundred girls like me. It made my cheeks burn, but I straightened my shoulders and headed to the elevator. Floor 12. Deep breath. Knock.

The door swung open, and there he was: David, he introduced himself with a warm handshake. Nothing like the monster my anxiety had conjured. Mid-thirties, fit from what looked like gym sessions, in a crisp white shirt unbuttoned at the collar. His room was a suite—plush king bed, mini-bar stocked with whiskies, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city skyline. 'Come in,' he said, voice smooth but edged with his own nervousness. We sat on the couch, him pouring us glasses of red wine. Conversation flowed easier than I expected. He was in town for a conference, divorced, kids grown and far away. 'It's lonely up here,' he admitted, eyes distant. 'Work fills the days, but nights... I just need someone real.' I shared bits of my life—university stories, my love for Kenyan poetry—keeping it light, human. 

An hour in, the air shifted. His hand brushed my knee, tentative. 'You're beautiful,' he murmured, leaning closer. My heart skipped, but I smiled, placing my hand over his. We kissed—soft at first, his lips tasting of wine, then deeper, tongues exploring. He pulled me onto his lap, hands roaming up my dress, cupping my ass through the lace. I ground against him, feeling his cock harden beneath his slacks, thick and insistent. 'Tell me what you like,' I whispered, channeling the confidence I'd faked all evening.

Things heated up fast. He unzipped my dress, letting it pool at my feet, eyes devouring my lingerie-clad body. His fingers traced my bra, thumbs circling my nipples until they peaked hard against the fabric. I unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his chest, tasting salt on his skin. We tumbled to the bed, him hovering over me, shedding clothes until we were both naked. His body was solid—broad shoulders, a slight paunch that felt real, endearing. He kissed down my neck, sucking gently, then lower to my breasts. His mouth latched onto one nipple, tongue flicking while his hand slid between my thighs.

When he touched my pussy, I gasped—his fingers parting my folds, slick already from the anticipation. 'So wet for me,' he groaned, circling my clit with just the right pressure. I arched, moaning as he dipped one finger inside, then two, pumping slowly, curling to hit that spot that made my toes curl. 'Fuck, that feels good,' I breathed, my nervousness melting into pure want. He ate me out next, spreading my legs wide, tongue lapping at my clit while his fingers thrust deeper. I came hard, thighs clamping his head, waves crashing through me like nothing I'd felt with past boyfriends.

I returned the favor, pushing him back and taking his cock in my hand—seven inches, veined, throbbing. I stroked him, then leaned down, licking from base to tip, savoring his musky taste. He groaned as I sucked him in, bobbing deep, my lips stretching around his girth. But he pulled me up. 'I need to be inside you.' Condom on, he positioned me on all fours, entering my pussy from behind in one smooth thrust. He fucked me so good—slow at first, building to hard, rhythmic pounds that slapped against my ass. His hands gripped my hips, pulling me back onto him, filling me completely. 'You're tight, so perfect,' he panted. I pushed back, meeting every stroke, my clit throbbing from the friction.

We switched—me on top, riding him, breasts bouncing as I ground down, his hands squeezing them. Then missionary, intimate, his eyes locked on mine as he drove deep. When he flipped me for more, sliding into my ass with lube—gentle, checking in—he made me come again, the fullness overwhelming. Finally, he pulled out, coming on my stomach with a shuddering groan, hot spurts painting my skin.

We lay there after, sweaty and spent, him stroking my hair. 'That was incredible,' he said, and I believed him. He fucked me so good I slept like a baby afterwards, curled up in the sheets until dawn. Waking to his soft snores, I slipped out quietly, but not before he pressed an envelope into my hand—20,000 KSh, a generous tip. Walking out of that hotel, cash in my purse, I felt empowered, not used. The money bought groceries for me and my family, paid a bill that had been haunting me, and left me with extra for a saloon day. But beyond the financial hit, it was the human side—the connection, the vulnerability we shared—that hooked me. This industry isn't just transactions; it's stories, escapes, real bonds in a fast city.

If you're curious about dipping your toes in, like I did, check out Alchemyst. It's the go-to platform in Nairobi for escorts, spas, OF models, masseuses, and more.
